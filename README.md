# pronounce_es
A modest attempt to compile a Spanish pronunciation dictionary in the tradition of the well-known and frequently-used
CMU corpus for English (http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict). Currently, there are about 14k "Latin American
Spanish" transcriptions.

## Contributing
Please feel free to contribute by adding missing transcriptions or fixing erroneous transcriptions in corpora/transcriptions_master.txt, or adding new words (You can use the "convert" function in ipa_to_sampa.py to get SAMPA from an IPA transcription). Submit your additions/changes as a pull request and I will review/sync them.
