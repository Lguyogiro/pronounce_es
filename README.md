# pronounce_es
A modest attempt to compile a Spanish pronunciation dictionary in the tradition of the well-known and frequently-used
CMU corpus for English (http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict). Currently, there are about 14k "Latin American
Spanish" transcriptions.

## Contributing
Please feel free to contribute by adding more transcriptions of the words in wordlist_es.txt, or adding new words to wordlist_es.txt along with their
transcriptions to ipa_transcriptions_es.txt and sampa_transcriptions_es.txt (Use the "convert" function in ipa_to_sampa.pyto get SAMPA from an
IPA transcription).
